        Cardiology is the study of the heart. Cardiology is a branch of medicine that deals with disorders of the heart
        and the cardiovascular system. The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects,
        coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, and electrophysiology. Physicians who specialize
        in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a specialty of internal medicine. Pediatric cardiologists
        are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called
        cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons, a specialty of general surgery.
        <br>
        <br>
        All cardiologists in the branch of medicine study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child
        heart disorders each require different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called
        "cardiologist") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to
        <div>
            treat adult heart disease. Surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of
            cardiothoracic surgery. For example, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and valve
            replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However, some minimally
            invasive
            procedures such as cardiac catheterization and pacemaker implantation are performed by cardiologists who
            have
            additional training in non-surgical interventions .

        Neurology is the branch of
        medicine dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the
        nervous system, which comprises the brain, the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.Neurological practice
        relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system.

        A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate, diagnose and treat
        neurological disorders. Neurologists diagnose and treat myriad neurologic conditions, including stroke,
        epilepsy, movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, brain infections, autoimmune neurologic disorders such
        as multiple sclerosis, sleep disorders, brain injury, headache disorders like migraine, tumors of the brain and
        dementias such as Alzheimer's disease.[3] Neurologists may also have roles in clinical research, clinical
        trials, and basic or translational research. Neurology is a nonsurgical specialty, its corresponding surgical
        specialty is neurosurgery.

        Surgery is a medical specialty that uses manual and/or instrumental techniques to physically reach into a
        subject's body in order to investigate or treat pathological conditions such as a disease or injury, to
        alter
        bodily functions (e.g. bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass), to improve appearance (cosmetic surgery),
        or
        to remove/replace unwanted tissues (body fat, glands, scars or skin tags) or foreign bodies. The subject
        receiving the surgery is typically a person (i.e. a patient), but can also be a non-human animal (i.e.
        veterinary surgery).

        The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure or operation, or simply "surgery". In this
        context, the verb "operate" means to perform surgery. The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery;
        e.g.
        surgical instruments, surgical facility or surgical nurse. Most surgical procedures are performed by a pair
        of
        operators: a surgeon who is the main operator performing the surgery, and a surgical assistant who provides
        in-procedure manual assistance during surgery. Modern surgical operations typically require a surgical team
        that
        typically consists of the surgeon, the surgical assistant, an anaesthetist (often also complemented by an
        anaesthetic nurse), a scrub nurse (who handles sterile equipment), a circulating nurse and a surgical
        technologist, while procedures that mandate cardiopulmonary bypass will also have a perfusionist. All
        surgical
        procedures are considered invasive and often require a period of postoperative care (sometimes intensive
        care)
        for the patient to recover from the iatrogenic trauma inflicted by the procedure. The duration of surgery
        can
        span from several minutes to tens of hours depending on the specialty, the nature of the condition, the
        target
        body parts involved and the circumstance of each procedure, but most surgeries are designed to be one-off
        interventions that are typically not intended as an ongoing or repeated type of treatment.

        In common colloquialism, the term "surgery" can also refer to the facility where surgery is performed, or,
        in
        British English, simply the office/clinic of a physician, dentist or veterinarian.

            alt="image" width="500px" height="300px">Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology, or anaesthesia is the medical
        specialty concerned with the total perioperative
        care of patients before, during and after surgery.[1] It encompasses anesthesia, intensive care medicine,
        critical emergency medicine, and pain medicine.[2] A physician specialized in anesthesiology is called an
        anesthesiologist, anaesthesiologist, or anaesthetist, depending on the country.[3][4][5][6] In some countries,
        the terms are synonymous, while in other countries they refer to different positions, and anesthetist is only
        used for non-physicians, such as nurse anesthetists.

        The core element of the specialty is the prevention and mitigation of pain and distress using various anesthetic
        agents, as well as the monitoring and maintenance of a patient's vital functions throughout the perioperative
        period.[7] Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist
        practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective
        field of medicine. In some countries anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in
        hospitals,[8][9] and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating
        room, including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine, running intensive care units,
        transporting critically ill patients between facilities, management of hospice and palliative care units, and
        prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery

        Radiology (/ˌreɪdɪˈɒlədʒi/ rey-dee-ol-uh-jee) is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose
        diseases and guide their treatment, within the bodies of humans and other animals. It began with radiography
        (which is why its name has a root referring to radiation), but today it includes all imaging modalities,
        including those that use no electromagnetic radiation (such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging),
        as well as others that do, such as computed tomography (CT), fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine including
        positron emission tomography (PET). Interventional radiology is the performance of usually minimally invasive
        medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies such as those mentioned above.

        The modern practice of radiology involves several different healthcare professions working as a team. The
        radiologist is a medical doctor who has completed the appropriate post-graduate training and interprets medical
        images, communicates these findings to other physicians by means of a report or verbally, and uses imaging to
        perform minimally invasive medical procedures.[1][2] The nurse is involved in the care of patients before and
        after imaging or procedures, including administration of medications, monitoring of vital signs and monitoring
        of sedated patients.[3] The radiographer, also known as a "radiologic technologist" in some countries such as
        the United States and Canada, is a specially trained healthcare professional that uses sophisticated technology
        and positioning techniques to produce medical images for the radiologist to interpret. Depending on the
        individual's training and country of practice, the radiographer may specialize in one of the above-mentioned
        imaging modalities or have expanded roles in image reporting.[4]

        Pathology is the study of the causes and effects of disease or injury.[1] The word pathology also refers to the
        study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of biology research fields and medical practices.
        However, when used in the context of modern medical treatment, the term is often used in a narrower fashion to
        refer to processes and tests that fall within the contemporary medical field of "general pathology", an area
        which includes a number of distinct but inter-related medical specialties that diagnose disease, mostly through
        analysis of tissue and human cell samples. Idiomatically, "a pathology" may also refer to the predicted or
        actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement "the many different forms of cancer have diverse
        pathologies", in which case a more proper choice of word would be "pathophysiologies"), and the affix pathy is
        sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as in cardiomyopathy) and
        psychological conditions (such as psychopathy).[2] A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist.

        As a field of general inquiry and research, pathology addresses components of disease: cause, mechanisms of
        development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of
        changes (clinical manifestations).[3] In common medical practice, general pathology is mostly concerned with
        analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for both infectious and non-infectious
        disease, and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties, anatomical pathology and clinical
        pathology.[4] Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types (comparing, for
        example, cytopathology, hematopathology, and histopathology), organs (as in renal pathology), and physiological
        systems (oral pathology), as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination (as with forensic pathology).

        Pathology is a significant field in modern medical diagnosis and medical research.

        Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of deleterious mental
        conditions.[1][2] These include various matters related to mood, behaviour, cognition, and perceptions.

        Initial psychiatric assessment of a person begins with a case history and mental status examination. Physical
        examinations, psychological tests, and laboratory tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other
        neurophysiological studies are performed.[3] Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with diagnostic
        manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD),[4] edited by the World Health Organization
        (WHO), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American
        Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5), published in May 2013, reorganized the
        categories of disorders and added newer information and insights consistent with current research.[5]

        Treatment may include psychotropics (psychiatric medicines) and psychotherapy,[6][7] and also other modalities
        such as assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, substance-abuse treatment, and supported
        employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of
        functional impairment or risk to the individual or community. Research within psychiatry is conducted on an
        interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, such as epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, occupational
        therapists, and clinical psychologists.

        Pediatrics (also spelled paediatrics or pædiatrics) is the branch of medicine that involves the medical care of
        infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. In the United Kingdom, paediatrics covers many of their youth
        until the age of 18.[1] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends people seek pediatric care through the age
        of 21, but some pediatric subspecialists continue to care for adults up to 25.[2][3] Worldwide age limits of
        pediatrics have been trending upward year after year.[4] A medical doctor who specializes in this area is known
        as a pediatrician, or paediatrician. The word pediatrics and its cognates mean "healer of children", derived
        from the two Greek words: παῖς (pais "child") and ἰατρός (iatros "doctor, healer"). Pediatricians work in
        clinics, research centers, universities, general hospitals and children's hospitals, including those who
        practice pediatric subspecialties (e.g. neonatology requires resources available in a NICU).

            Urology (from Greek οὖρον ouron "urine" and -λογία -logia "study of"), also known as genitourinary surgery,
            is the branch of medicine that focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the urinary-tract system and the
            reproductive organs. Organs under the domain of urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters,
            urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal
            vesicles, prostate, and penis).

            The urinary and reproductive tracts are closely linked, and disorders of one often affect the other. Thus a
            major spectrum of the conditions managed in urology exists under the domain of genitourinary disorders.
            Urology combines the management of medical (i.e., non-surgical) conditions, such as urinary-tract infections
            and benign prostatic hyperplasia, with the management of surgical conditions such as bladder or prostate
            cancer, kidney stones, congenital abnormalities, traumatic injury, and stress incontinence.[1]

            Urological techniques include minimally invasive robotic and laparoscopic surgery, laser-assisted surgeries,
            and other scope-guided procedures. Urologists receive training in open and minimally invasive surgical
            techniques, employing real-time ultrasound guidance, fiber-optic endoscopic equipment, and various lasers in
            the treatment of multiple benign and malignant conditions.[2][3] Urology is closely related to (and
            urologists often collaborate with the practitioners of) oncology, nephrology, gynaecology, andrology,
            pediatric surgery, colorectal surgery, gastroenterology, and endocrinology.

            Urology is one of the most competitive and highly sought surgical specialties for physicians, with new
            urologists comprising less than 1.5% of United States medical-school graduates each year.[4][5]

            Urologists are physicians which have specialized in the field after completing their general degree in
            medicine. Upon successful completion of a residency program, many urologists choose to undergo further
            advanced training in a subspecialty area of expertise through a fellowship lasting an additional 12 to 36
            months. Subspecialties may include: urologic surgery, urologic oncology and urologic oncological surgery,
            endourology and endourologic surgery, urogynecology and urogynecologic surgery, reconstructive urologic
            surgery (a form of reconstructive surgery), minimally-invasive urologic surgery, pediatric urology and
            pediatric urologic surgery (including adolescent urology, the treatment of premature or delayed puberty, and
            the treatment of congenital urological syndromes, malformations, and deformations), transplant urology (the
            field of transplant medicine and surgery concerned with transplantation of organs such as the kidneys,
            bladder tissue, ureters, and, recently, penises), voiding dysfunction, paruresis, neurourology, and
            androurology and sexual medicine. Additionally, some urologists supplement their fellowships with a master's
            degree (2–3 years) or with a Ph.D. (4–6 years) in related topics to prepare them for academic as well as
            focused clinical employment.

            edicine is the science[1] and practice[2] of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis,
            prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine
            encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and
            treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and
            medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or
            surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical
            devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[3]

            Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of
            creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local
            culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient
            philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent
            centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science
            (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for
            sutures is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in
            the tissues being stitched arises through science.

            Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in
            the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside
            of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.

            Neurosurgery or neurological surgery, known in common parlance as brain surgery, is the medical specialty
            concerned with the surgical treatment of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including
            the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system.[1]
            General neurosurgery involves most neurosurgical conditions including neuro-trauma and other
            neuro-emergencies such as intracranial hemorrhage. Most level 1 hospitals have this kind of practice.[31]

            Specialized branches have developed to cater to special and difficult conditions. These specialized branches
            co-exist with general neurosurgery in more sophisticated hospitals. To practice advanced specialization
            within neurosurgery, additional higher fellowship training of one to two years is expected from the
            neurosurgeon. Some of these divisions of neurosurgery are:

            Vascular neurosurgery includes clipping of aneurysms and performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
            Stereotactic neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, and epilepsy surgery (the latter includes partial or
            total corpus callosotomy severing part or all of the corpus callosum to stop or lessen seizure spread and
            activity, and the surgical removal of functional, physiological and/or anatomical pieces or divisions of the
            brain, called epileptic foci, that are operable and that are causing seizures, and also the more radical and
            rare partial or total lobectomy, or even hemispherectomy the removal of part or all of one of the lobes,
            or one of the cerebral hemispheres of the brain; those two procedures, when possible, are also very, very
            rarely used in oncological neurosurgery or to treat very severe neurological trauma, such as stab or gunshot
            wounds to the brain)
            Oncological neurosurgery also called neurosurgical oncology; includes pediatric oncological neurosurgery;
            treatment of benign and malignant central and peripheral nervous system cancers and pre-cancerous lesions in
            adults and children (including, among others, glioblastoma multiforme and other gliomas, brain stem cancer,
            astrocytoma, pontine glioma, medulloblastoma, spinal cancer, tumors of the meninges and intracranial spaces,
            secondary metastases to the brain, spine, and nerves, and peripheral nervous system tumors)
            Skull base surgery
            Spinal neurosurgery
            Peripheral nerve surgery
            Pediatric neurosurgery (for cancer, seizures, bleeding, stroke, cognitive disorders or congenital
            neurological disorders)

            gastrointestinal tract, sometimes referred to as the GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, small
            intestine and large intestine as well as the accessory organs of digestion which include the pancreas,

            peristalsis, break down that material via digestion, absorb nutrients for use throughout the body, and
            remove waste from the body via defecation.[3] Physicians who specialize in the medical specialty of
            gastroenterology are called gastroenterologists or sometimes GI doctors. Some of the most common conditions
            managed by gastroenterologists include gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, irritable
            bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
            peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder and biliary tract disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, colon polyps

            Hematology (always spelled haematology in British English) is the branch of medicine concerned with the
            study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood.[1][2] It involves
            treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin,
            blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such
            diseases might include hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, blood clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and
            blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.[3] The laboratory analysis of blood is
            frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist.
            Physicians specialized in hematology are known as hematologists or haematologists. Their routine work mainly
            includes the care and treatment of patients with hematological diseases, although some may also work at the
            hematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various
            hematological test results and blood clotting test results. In some institutions, hematologists also manage
            the hematology laboratory. Physicians who work in hematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them,
            are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of hematological diseases, referred to as hematopathologists
            or haematopathologists. Hematologists and hematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a
            diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed. Hematology is a distinct subspecialty of
            internal medicine, separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical oncology. Hematologists
            may specialize further or have special interests, for example, in:

            treating bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
            treating hematological malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia (cancers)
            treating hemoglobinopathies
            the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank

            Endocrinology (from endocrine + -ology) is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine
            system, its diseases, and its specific secretions known as hormones. It is also concerned with the
            integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and the psychological or
            behavioral activities of metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration,
            excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception caused by hormones.
            Specializations include behavioral endocrinology and comparative endocrinology.[1]

            The endocrine system consists of several glands, all in different parts of the body, that secrete hormones
            directly into the blood rather than into a duct system. Therefore, endocrine glands are regarded as ductless
            glands. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action; one hormone may have several effects on
            different target organs, and, conversely, one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone.

            Nephrology (from Greek nephros "kidney", combined with the suffix -logy, "the study of") is a specialty of
            adult internal medicine and pediatric medicine that concerns the study of the kidneys, specifically normal
            kidney function (renal physiology) and kidney disease (renal pathophysiology), the preservation of kidney
            health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to renal replacement therapy (dialysis
            and kidney transplantation). The word "renal" is an adjective meaning "relating to the kidneys", and its
            roots are French or late Latin. Whereas according to some opinions, "renal" and "nephro" should be replaced
            with "kidney" in scientific writings such as "kidney medicine" (instead of nephrology) or "kidney
            replacement therapy", other experts have advocated preserving the use of renal and nephro as appropriate
            including in "nephrology" and "renal replacement therapy", respectively.[1]

            Nephrology also studies systemic conditions that affect the kidneys, such as diabetes and autoimmune
            disease; and systemic diseases that occur as a result of kidney disease, such as renal osteodystrophy and
            hypertension. A physician who has undertaken additional training and become certified in nephrology is
            called a nephrologist.

            The term "nephrology" was first used in about 1960, according to the French "néphrologie" proposed by Pr.
            Jean Hamburger in 1953, from the Greek νεφρός / nephrós (kidney). Before then, the specialty was usually
            referred to as "kidney medicine"

            Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction or alteration of the human
            body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery.
            Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of
            burns. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning,
            cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it.[1]

            Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine,[1] is a medical specialty focused on providing care for the unique health
            needs of the elderly.[2] The term geriatrics originates from the Greek γέρων geron meaning "old man", and
            ιατρός iatros meaning "healer". It aims to promote health by preventing, diagnosing and treating disease in
            older adults.[3] There is no defined age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or
            geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of older people. Rather, this decision is
            guided by individual patient need and the caregiving structures available to them. This care may benefit
            those who are managing multiple chronic conditions or experiencing significant age-related complications
            that threaten quality of daily life. Geriatric care may be indicated if caregiving responsibilities become
            increasingly stressful or medically complex for family and caregivers to manage independently.[4]

            There is a distinction between geriatrics and gerontology. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary study of the
            aging process, defined as the decline in organ function over time in the absence of injury, illness,
            environmental risks or behavioral risk factors.[5] However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical
            gerontology.
